Mobile music discovery app offering 30-second clips in a vertical scrollable format, inspired by TikTok and YouTube Shorts, but entirely dedicated to music. Users personalize their experience by selecting their favorite musical genres, so they're only presented with clips that match their tastes. With a simple swipe, they can add their favorites to save them in their personal library and access the full tracks anytime.

Instructions for trying the application are available [here](https://github.com/vlanp/scroll-song-frontend?tab=readme-ov-file#try-it "Link to the GitHub Readme").
